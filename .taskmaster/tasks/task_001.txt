# Task ID: 1
# Title: Setup Next.js Project with TypeScript
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize a new Next.js project with TypeScript support and set up the basic project structure.
# Details:
Use create-next-app to set up a new Next.js project with TypeScript. Configure ESLint and Prettier for code quality. Set up a basic folder structure for components, pages, and styles. Install necessary dependencies such as react, react-dom, and next. Use Next.js version 13.4.4 or later to leverage the latest features and optimizations.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that the project builds without errors and that the development server runs correctly. Check that TypeScript compilation works as expected.
