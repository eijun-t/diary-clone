# Description: Create a user interface to display character feedback to users.

### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a header component with tabs for navigating between all feedback and favorites.
### Details:
Create components/feedback/FeedbackHeader.tsx with tabs for 'All Feedback' and 'Favorites'. Implement active state styling for the current tab.

### Description: Develop a component to display detailed information about a single feedback entry.
### Details:
Create components/feedback/FeedbackDetail.tsx that displays comprehensive information about a feedback entry including full content, metadata, and actions (such as favorite toggle).

Each page should use the appropriate components created in previous subtasks. Implement data fetching for each route and handle loading/error states. Refactor the existing feedback page to use the new components as specified in the additional context.
