# Task ID: 9
# Title: Implement Feedback Generation Scheduler
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a system to automatically generate feedback at 4 AM daily.
# Details:
Use node-cron (version 3.0.2 or later) to schedule daily tasks. Implement a serverless function (e.g., using Vercel Serverless Functions) to handle the scheduled task. Fetch relevant diary entries, generate feedback using OpenAI API, and store results in Supabase.

# Test Strategy:
Test the scheduler with different time zones. Verify that feedback is generated and stored correctly.
