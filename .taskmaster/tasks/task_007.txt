### Dependencies: 7.3
### Description: Implement utility functions to handle character selection, rotation, and ensuring all 8 characters provide feedback as required.
### Details:
Create logic to select characters for feedback, rotate through all 8, and support favorite registration. Ensure only favorite characters are persisted outside the DB as specified.

## 5. Integrate Character System with UI Components [done]
### Dependencies: 7.4
### Description: Connect the character system to the feedback and detail card UI, supporting display, selection, and favorite registration.
