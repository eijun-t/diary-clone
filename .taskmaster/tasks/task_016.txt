# Task ID: 16
# Title: Add Data Persistence and Offline Support
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 5, 10
# Priority: low
# Description: Implement data persistence and offline functionality using service workers and IndexedDB.
# Details:
Use next-pwa (version 5.6.0 or later) to add Progressive Web App (PWA) capabilities. Implement service workers for offline caching of assets and API responses. Use idb (version 7.1.1 or later) for client-side storage of diary entries and feedback. Implement sync functionality to update Supabase when online.

# Test Strategy:
Test offline functionality by disabling network connection. Verify that the app works offline and syncs data when connection is restored.
