# Task ID: 8
# Title: Integrate OpenAI API for Feedback Generation
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 7
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up the OpenAI API integration for generating character feedback.
# Details:
Install openai npm package (version 3.2.1 or later). Set up environment variables for OpenAI API key. Create a utility function to generate prompts based on diary content and character personality. Implement error handling and retry logic for API calls.

# Test Strategy:
Test API integration with mock diary entries. Verify that generated feedback matches character personalities.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Install and Configure OpenAI SDK [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Install the openai npm package (version 3.2.1 or later) and ensure it is properly added to the project dependencies.
### Details:
Run 'npm install openai' in the project directory and verify the installation. Import the OpenAI SDK in the main application file.

## 2. Set Up Environment Variables for API Key [done]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Create and configure an environment file to securely store the OpenAI API key.
### Details:
Add the API key to a .env file and ensure it is loaded using a package like dotenv. Update .gitignore to exclude the .env file from version control.

## 3. Develop Prompt Generation Utility [done]
### Dependencies: 8.2
### Description: Create a utility function that generates prompts based on diary content and character personality traits.
### Details:
Design the function to accept diary content and character data as input, and output a well-structured prompt suitable for the OpenAI API.

## 4. Implement Feedback Generation Logic [done]
### Dependencies: 8.3
### Description: Integrate the OpenAI API call to generate feedback using the constructed prompts.
### Details:
Use the OpenAI SDK to send the generated prompt to the API and retrieve the feedback response.

## 5. Add Error Handling and Retry Logic [done]
### Dependencies: 8.4
### Description: Implement robust error handling and retry mechanisms for API calls to ensure reliability.
### Details:
Detect and handle common API errors, implement retries with exponential backoff, and log errors for monitoring.
