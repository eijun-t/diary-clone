# Title: Create Diary Entry Creation Interface
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop a user interface for creating new diary entries.
# Details:
Create a React component for the diary entry form. Use react-hook-form (version 7.44.2 or later) for form management and validation. Implement a rich text editor using react-quill (version 2.0.0 or later) for enhanced diary entry formatting. Add functionality to save entries to Supabase.

# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests for the diary entry form component. Test form validation and submission process.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Dedicated Diary Entry Page Route [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up a new route at '/diary/new' in the React application to serve as the dedicated page for creating new diary entries.
### Details:
Configure the routing logic (e.g., using React Router) to render the diary entry creation component when users navigate to '/diary/new'. Ensure the page is mobile-first and accessible.

## 2. Implement Diary Entry Form UI [done]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Develop the form UI with a plain textarea for entry content and an emoji-based mood selector.
### Details:
Use react-hook-form (v7.44.2+) for form state management. The form should include a textarea for the diary content and a set of emoji buttons for mood selection. Ensure the UI is mobile-friendly and accessible.

## 3. Add Form Validation [done]
### Dependencies: 4.2
### Description: Implement validation rules for the diary entry form using react-hook-form.
### Details:
Require that the diary content is not empty and that a mood is selected before allowing submission. Display clear error messages for invalid input.

## 4. Create Supabase Database Insertion Function [done]
### Dependencies: 4.3
### Description: Develop a function to insert new diary entries into Supabase, creating a new record for each submission.
### Details:
Implement a simple insertion function that takes the diary content, selected mood, and timestamp, and saves them as a new entry in the Supabase database. No checks for existing entries are needed.

## 5. Implement Save Functionality and Error Handling [done]
### Dependencies: 4.4
### Description: Connect the form submission to the Supabase insertion function and handle errors gracefully.
### Details:
Trigger the save operation only when the 'Save' button is pressed. Show loading indicators and display user-friendly error messages if the save fails. Reset the form or provide feedback on successful save.
