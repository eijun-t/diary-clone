# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement Diary Entry Listing and Calendar View
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create interfaces for listing diary entries and viewing them in a calendar format.
# Details:
Develop a list view component for diary entries. Implement a calendar view using react-big-calendar (version 1.6.9 or later). Fetch diary entries from Supabase and populate both views. Implement pagination for the list view and date range selection for the calendar view.

# Test Strategy:
Test the rendering of both list and calendar views. Verify correct data fetching and display. Test pagination and date range selection functionality.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Tabbed Interface for List and Calendar Views [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Extend the existing /diary/page.tsx to support tab switching between the list and calendar views within the same page.
### Details:
Implement a tabbed UI that allows users to switch between the diary entry list and the calendar view, ensuring seamless transitions and state management.

## 2. Implement Diary Entry List View with Pagination [done]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Develop a list view component that displays diary entries in descending order, showing the first ~20 characters of each entry and paginating 10 entries per page.
### Details:
Fetch diary entries from Supabase, sort them by newest first, and display only the first 20 characters per entry. Add pagination controls to navigate through pages of 10 entries each.

## 3. Integrate react-calendar for Monthly Calendar View [done]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Implement a monthly calendar view using react-calendar, displaying a dot on dates with diary entries and supporting Japanese localization.
### Details:
Configure react-calendar for monthly display, localize to Japanese, and visually indicate dates with diary entries using small dots. Ensure initial view is the current month.

## 4. Enable Date Selection and Entry Detail Display in Calendar View [done]
### Dependencies: 5.3
### Description: Allow users to click a date in the calendar to view detailed diary entries for that day in a lower section of the calendar view.
### Details:
Implement click handlers for calendar dates. When a date with entries is clicked, fetch and display the full details of those entries below the calendar.

## 5. Fetch and Synchronize Diary Entries from Supabase for Both Views [done]
### Dependencies: 5.2, 5.3
### Description: Implement data fetching logic to retrieve diary entries from Supabase and ensure both the list and calendar views are populated and synchronized.
### Details:
Centralize data fetching to avoid duplication, handle loading and error states, and ensure updates in one view are reflected in the other.
