# Title: Implement Context Management for Long-term Dialogue
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop a system to manage and summarize long-term context for AI interactions.
# Details:
Implement a context management system using a combination of database storage and in-memory caching (e.g., Redis). Create utility functions to summarize past interactions using OpenAI's summarization capabilities. Implement a system to rotate and update context based on relevance and recency.

# Test Strategy:
Test context summarization with various interaction histories. Verify that context is correctly maintained and updated over time.
