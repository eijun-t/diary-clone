# Task ID: 11
# Title: Implement Context Management for Long-term Dialogue
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop a system to manage and summarize long-term context for AI interactions.
# Details:
Implement a context management system using a combination of database storage and in-memory caching (e.g., Redis). Create utility functions to summarize past interactions using OpenAI's summarization capabilities. Implement a system to rotate and update context based on relevance and recency.

# Test Strategy:
Test context summarization with various interaction histories. Verify that context is correctly maintained and updated over time.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design and Create Character Context Database Schema [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and implement the database schema for character-specific context management in Supabase, including tables for storing raw interactions and hierarchical summaries.
### Details:
Create the following tables in Supabase: 1) character_context_raw - stores recent raw interactions with timestamp, user_id, character_id, and content fields; 2) character_context_summaries - stores hierarchical summaries with user_id, character_id, summary_type (weekly, monthly, quarterly), period_start, period_end, and summary_content fields. Include appropriate indexes and foreign key relationships. Ensure the schema supports filtering interactions by character and excluding cross-character information.

## 2. Implement Context Collection System [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.1
### Description: Develop functions to collect and store relevant context data per user-character pair, including chat history, diary entries, and feedback.
### Details:
Create utility functions to: 1) Capture and store new interactions in character_context_raw; 2) Retrieve character-specific information from existing tables (chats, diaries, feedback); 3) Filter data to ensure character isolation (no cross-character information sharing); 4) Implement retention policy to maintain only the most recent week of raw data. Use Supabase client for all database operations.

## 3. Develop Weekly Summary Generation System [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.2
### Description: Create a system to generate weekly summaries of user-character interactions using OpenAI's summarization capabilities.
### Details:
Implement functions to: 1) Retrieve a week's worth of raw interactions for a specific user-character pair; 2) Use OpenAI API to generate concise, meaningful summaries; 3) Store these summaries in the character_context_summaries table with type 'weekly'; 4) Include metadata about the time period covered. Optimize prompt design for effective summarization that preserves key information while reducing token count.

## 4. Implement Hierarchical Summary System [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.3
### Description: Develop a system to create higher-level summaries (monthly, quarterly) from collections of weekly summaries, forming a hierarchical context structure.
### Details:
Create functions to: 1) Identify when 10 weekly summaries are available for aggregation; 2) Retrieve and combine these summaries; 3) Generate a higher-level summary using OpenAI; 4) Store in character_context_summaries with appropriate summary_type; 5) Implement recursive summarization for even longer-term context (quarterly from monthly, etc.). Design the system to maintain a balance between detail preservation and context compression.

## 5. Integrate Context Management with Chat System [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.4
### Description: Integrate the context management system with the existing chat functionality, including context retrieval for chat sessions and scheduled summary generation.
### Details:
Implement: 1) A context builder function that assembles relevant context for a chat session by combining recent raw interactions with appropriate summaries; 2) A weekly scheduled task to trigger summary generation for all active user-character pairs; 3) Integration points with the existing chat system to provide context to the AI model; 4) Optimization to ensure context stays within token limits while prioritizing relevant information. Update the chat interface to utilize the new context management system.
