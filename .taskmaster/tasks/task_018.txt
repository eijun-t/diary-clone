# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17
# Priority: high
# Description: Conduct a security audit of the application and implement necessary optimizations.
# Details:
Use OWASP ZAP or a similar tool to perform a security scan. Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) headers. Ensure all API endpoints are properly secured. Optimize API calls and implement caching where appropriate. Use React.memo and useMemo for performance optimization. Implement lazy loading for images and components.

# Test Strategy:
Conduct penetration testing to identify security vulnerabilities. Use Lighthouse or similar tools to measure and improve performance metrics.
